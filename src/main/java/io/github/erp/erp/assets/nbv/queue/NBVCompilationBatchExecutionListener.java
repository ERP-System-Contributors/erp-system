        * I know you are wondering but I too have no idea why the queue is constantly presenting a

        * am just effing clueless. Even running the debugger at TRACE log levels I still haven't figured this
        * issue out; may be I should stop using kafka...
        * May be I should use my own factories instead of spring-kafka.
        * This listener is especially suspect. May be I should implement a listener manually. It will be painful and
        * full of errors, but that's how you effing grow, right? Rather than putting your head in the sand
        * and hope the problem will go away? Spring-kafka makes things easy with the annotation magic
        * but let's be honest, this thing of people doing things behind your back, behind the scenes and present
        * that everything is okay, gets old like really really fast. Even if you are not smart enough
        * you eventually figure something is going on and it will piss you off real bad. This is about
        * spring and this is not about spring. How about an interface that openly at least shows how
        * the messages are configured? It's a message queue for pete's sake, how did they ever think that
        * they can simplify things by hiding that interface? Just present the whole goddamn API and those
        * developers who cannot manage will know from day 1 to not ever touch kafka even if their lives
        * depended on it. Life can be Darwinian like that and it's just silly to pretend otherwise.
