/**

 * The adjustment amount is subtracted from the cost item itself, prior to running the depreciation
 * sequence at a specified point in time after which the adjustment is effective. The implementation
 * allows for multiple events which means possibility of staggered write-offs.
 * Because we are using point-in-time calculations which depend solely on the asset cost at
 * capitalization date, the adjustment is applied to the asset cost at capitalization date
 * as though we were revising the initial value of the asset before calculating depreciation. Such
 * revaluation is irrelevant until the adjustment's effective period aligns with the current
 * depreciation-job's depreciation period.
