         * So this is very interesting because one would think that simply because the object
         * contains a report template object, "why don't I just get a report template byte stream from there?"
         * Right? But you would be mistaken. Apparently that would just lead you to null pointer exceptions
         * that you would be looking for, for the rest of your life. Hibernate needs to have a way
         * of explicitly showing that to poor devs like me, though am certain they have said that
         * somewhere in the specification as they explain, "the complex nature of many to one relationships".
         * So anyway, that's why against better advise I've had to inject the service instance
         * for report-template, (WHICH I DID IN THE CALLER AS WELL); and you can see why this excites our puzzlement especially if there
         * was a time you religiously signed up and followed Bob's DRY design pattern. So am not picking
         * up the pitch forks yet, but am starting to take stock of where I keep the sharp tools. Of course
         * if am to take this to stackoverflow the folks there would have a field day on how people should get
         * into the habit of actually reading their documentation and so on and so forth. But this is Java
         * for heaven's sake and people who use Java are people who like things expressed in explicit terms: like
         * you don't just say that a particular method could burn your hands in the comments, we want to see
         * it in the code. Is that too much to ask? Huh? Am I rambling too much and would I know if I did? I guess not
         * *sigh* But why in the SEVEN HELLS am I injecting the reporting-template-service here if I'd already
         * done it the caller and fetched a fresh instance of the report-template from the repository? As in it's
         * right there IN THE ARGUMENTS!!!!!! Anyway, I was just venting, so I will delete this comment, and no one
         * will have to see it...
